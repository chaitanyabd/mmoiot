Massive Multi-user Online framework for Internet of Things.

- Framework
A tried and tested framework that supports everything from location tracking to up to a 100 discrete sensors. Built upon the versatile Node.JS platform. You will need an API key to use it though. 

- Circuits
Heavily standardized circuitry with some of our own innovations. Aimed at comprehensive Vehicle Assurance &trade; (more than just fleet tracking). 

Circuits are purchaseable within India, in the form of Whitelabel (unbranded) Ready-to-roll kits. Just take the kit and you're set to build your own platform. 

- Sensors
The device core can power a large number of sensors, depending upon the type of sensor in use. Some sensors we can possibly support only one (I2C sensors) - but others built around OneWire or Serial we can support many. 

You can purchase packaged weather-proof sensors from us, again fully Whitelabelled. Just take the bundle and you're set to roll your own IOT Sensor Network.

- Server software
Our server is fully open and free to use - high performance API allow you to interact seamlessly with your device. Full failure-and-reset control to allow optimum performance even in the worst of conditions. 

Note that our platform is not guaranteed to focus on Real-Time or Emergency service use. While we're reasonably sure it'll work well - such use should be avoided until further notice.
